This is just a basic Flask app that is tied to an AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment. 
The webpage is using Bootstrap.

This page is supposed to be dedicated to my own personal resume page. It is a single page website that will have a youtube video as the whole landing page.

Beneath it there will be small amounts of text and at the bottom some contact info. 

Hopefully no one ever really sees this page..
